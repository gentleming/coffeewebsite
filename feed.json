You get to drink coffee all day long, perhaps partake in a few adult refreshments, some tasty bites, and maybe attend a talk or panel discussion. What’s not to love? And is there ever a whole lot to love at the <a href=\"https://www.sfcoffeefestival.com/\" class=\"addbackground\">San Francisco Coffee Festiva</a>l. Happening the weekend of November 2nd and 3rd at the <a href=\"https://fortmason.org/about/\" class=\"addbackground\">Mason Center for Arts and Culture</a>, the San Francisco Coffee Festival is a celebration of the Bay Area coffee culture and beyond.</p>\n<p>With a total of 56 roasters exhibiting, the SFCF has a strong mix of local, in-state, and national roasters for attendees to choose from.

You can learn about Coffee With A Purpose from Royal Coffee’s Chris Kornman or the Art of Espresso-ion with <a href=\"https://www.coffeemanufactory.com/\" class=\"addbackground\">Coffee Manufactory</a>’s Tricia Lu or even attend the Bartenders &amp; Baristas Blend led by none other than <a href=\"https://sprudgelive.com/martin-hudak-wins-2017-world-coffee-good-spirits/\" class=\"addbackground\">2017 World Coffee in Good Spirits Champion</a> Martin Hudak.</p>\n<p>There’s going to be coffee art activations, live music, and a whole host of tasty bites to help you come down from the coffee high. There’s more than a day’s worth of things to do, so come hungry and thirsty.</p>\n<p>Tickets for the San Francisco Coffee Festival range from $29 for a three-hour session pass to $45 for a full day pass all the way up to $69 for an all-day VIP pass, all of which can be purchased <a href=\"https://www.sfcoffeefestival.com/tickets\" class=\"addbackground\">here</a>.
